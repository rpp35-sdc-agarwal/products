# Fec
To begin working with the FEC repo you must first clone it down to your personal machine using the git clone command

After you have cloned the FEC repo be sure to:

checkout and create a branch that you will do your personal work on,
run npm install for your dependencies,
write a .babelrc configuration file with both env and react presets

The code for each widget will be within its corresponding folder contained in the /client/src directory.
Be sure to commit frequently and push to your personal branch.
